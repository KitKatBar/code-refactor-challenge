# Code Refactor Challenge - Horiseon Website

## Description

Web accessibility is an increasingly important consideration for businesses. It ensures that people with disabilities can access a website using assistive technologies such as video captions, screen readers, and braille keyboards. Making a website accessible is also good for business for many reasons, one of them being that accessible sites are better positioned in search engines like Google. It also helps companies avoid litigation that can occur when people with disabilities can't access their website.

In order to do that, this code was refactored and improved for long-term sustainability.  Hyperlinks in the navigation bar have been updated to function correctly.  The HTML elements has been updated to follow the standard semantic structure guidelines to better position the website's visibility in search engines.  The CSS has been updated by removing redundant selectors and properties and has been consolidated and reorganized in according with the structure of the HTML elements.

## Installation

No installation is required!  This code has been deployed to GitHub Pages so that you can view it on your own device.  To do so, please visit the following link: https://kitkatbar.github.io/code-refactor-challenge/

## Usage

Please refer to this image showing the layout of the application: https://github.com/KitKatBar/code-refactor-challenge/blob/main/assets/images/01-html-css-git-homework-demo.png

The navigation bar at the top right should all link to their respective sections when you click on them.  Each of the images/icons will have alternative text should they break, except for the image below the navigation bar and above all the other pieces of content because this is only for decorative purposes.  To view the alternative text, you may open the Chrome DevTools by pressing Command+Option+I (macOS) or Control+Shift+I (Windows) or you can right click -> 'Inspect' on each of the images/icons.  Please note that this is for Google Chrome and may be different if you are using different browsers.  If you used right click -> 'Inspect' on each of the images/icons, you should be able to already see the alternative text fo each of the images/icons.  Otherwise, you will need to navigate the HTML elements in Chrome DevTools to find the alternative texts.
